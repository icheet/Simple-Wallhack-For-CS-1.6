-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use:
choose the "WallHack" option and put model, then go to "Extra Models" and select "Lambert", after that you are ready to use
the no recoil its not kinda a no recoil, its more of a recoil control
the rest just work fine i guess.
