# Simple-Wallhack-For-CS-1.6
A simple wallhack for cs 1.6 made with cshackcreator v2 demo by BloodSharp

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How To Use: 

choose the "WallHack" option and put model, then go to "Extra Models" and select "Lambert", after that you are ready to use
the no recoil its not kinda a no recoil, its more of a recoil control
the rest just work fine i guess.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this is just a test, ill start to learn C++, but this is just a test, this is crap but if you wanna test it, here ya go.
Its most probally undetected since you can just use cs 1.6 Protocol 48 and other cs 1.6 and you can also play legit in other servers (just dont be too blatant)
